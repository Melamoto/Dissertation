The procedure for evaluating the subjective quality of a process should be
undertaken as follows:

Preparation of data:

  - Find a selection of 4-10 appropriate musical pieces in 4/4 meter with length
    8-16 bars
  - For each of the pieces, create a sample replacing the final 4 bars from the
    end with a machine composition (interacting with the original composer)

Testing procedure (repeat for each sample piece):

  - Give subject both the original and the modified piece in a random order
  - Allow subject up to 3 minutes listening time
  - Ask the subject to answer which piece they believe was composed by a machine
  - Ask the subject to then rate each piece's quality on a scale 1-10
  - Ask the subject for any additional comments on why they made their decision


Important detail:
Should the machine-generated piece be allowed to be "touched up" by human hands?
For all practical purposes the machine's work would be touched up by a human,
but the more modification is allowed the more the actual work of the machine is
obscured.
The ideal scenario here would be defining an allowed "edit distance" - a strict
limit to the extent to which the composer may adjust the machine's work. A good
edit distance will be hard to find however, as the balance is quite delicate.

Also, answering previous questions may influence the subject's answer to a later
question. This is not very avoidable with the experiment structure as is, and it
is unlikely that this can be avoided.
