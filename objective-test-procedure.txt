The procedure for evaluating the objective quality of a process should be
undertaken as follows:

Preparation of data:

  - Find a selection of 15-40 appropriate similar musical pieces in 4/4 meter
    with length 16 bars within the same genre
  - For each of the pieces, create a sample replacing the final 4 bars from the
    end with a machine composition (interacting with a skilled composer)

Testing procedure (repeat for each sample):
  - Use a similarity metric to measure the whole machine-composed sample to the
    original set of music

The evaluation metric of this test is the set of estimated similarities to the
set of original pieces compared to the similarity of the original set to itself.

Important detail:
Similarity metrics like this are rare and very imperfect. Most notably,
similarity metrics are a type of fitness measure - by definition a "good"
similarity metric solves the problem this research is trying to solve. The best
solution for this is to simply attempt to repeat this test with many different
metrics. It does not indicate quality, but it at least demonstrates
computational consistency - quality must be determined by subjective tests instead.
